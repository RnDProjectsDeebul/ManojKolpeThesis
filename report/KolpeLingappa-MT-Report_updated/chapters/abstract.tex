        Stereo vision is one of the field of computer vision that targets to construct the 3D model of a object using images. Over the past years a large number of algorithms and architectures have been proposed to find the 3D geometry of the object. However, a lack of dataset taken at varying environmental conditions made it difficult to compare the performance of the algorithms. It takes a lot of time to process large images and bad reconstruction with the low textured images. Most of the state of the art depth estimation algorithm are computationally heavy and cannot be deployed on the edge device. A light weight architecture with reasonable performance needs to be developed to deploy in a low computational power devices. Conventional approaches uses two view stereo rigs for reconstruction. However, estimation of depth from unconstrained monocular camera images is a challenging task. There are advantage of using the moving camera. Firstly with larger baseline the accuracy of the distant object can be improved. Secondly with multiple varying point images are able to fuse all the information for robust and stable depth estimation. This work concentrate on the depth estimation from unconstrained monocular camera images and extension of the disparity map estimation architecture to the segmentation.
