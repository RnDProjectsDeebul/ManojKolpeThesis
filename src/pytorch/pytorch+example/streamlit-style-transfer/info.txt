Hi guys, welcome to a new PyTorch tutorial
Today we'll be implementing a style transfer application with PyTorch
and streamlit.
So style transfer means that we have an input image, 
and also another image in a certain style. And then we apply
the style to the new image.

mosaic style

So this here is in the officoal pytorch examples repo on GitHub.
so we are going to wrap this code into a streamlit application.
If you don't know streamlit, then here's a quick overview.
Streamlit is an open source framework for building machine
learning web apps with a nice UI. I already have a whole tutorial
about this that you can check out. But it is not necessary.
Streamlit is very easy to use, so you should be able to follow 
along today.
